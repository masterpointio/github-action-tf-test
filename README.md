## Purpose and Functionality

A reusable GitHub Action for testing Terraform and OpenTofu modules.

This action:

- Automates the process of running tests on your infrastructure code
- Supports optional AWS credentials configuration via OIDC
- Aqua-based dependency management
- Caching for faster execution
- Configurable AWS region and role session name

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: TF Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  tf-test:
    name: üß™ ${{ matrix.tf }} test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        tf: [tofu, terraform]
    steps:
      - uses: masterpointio/github-action-tf-test/action.yaml@v1.0.0
        with:
          tf_type: ${{ matrix.tf }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### AWS Configuration

The action supports AWS authentication in two ways:

1. **Organization-level Environment Variable (Recommended)**

   - Set `TF_TEST_AWS_ROLE_ARN` in your GitHub organization's environment variables
   - This value will be automatically available to all workflows

2. **Input Parameter**
   - Pass the AWS role ARN directly in the workflow:
   ```yaml
   with:
     aws_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/your-role"
   ```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter           | Required | Default                 | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tf_type`           | Yes      | -                       | Type of terraform to use (`tofu` or `terraform`)                                          |
| `aws_role_arn`      | No       | -                       | AWS role ARN to assume for testing (takes precedence over `TF_TEST_AWS_ROLE_ARN` env var) |
| `aws_region`        | No       | `us-east-1`             | AWS region to use                                                                         |
| `github_token`      | Yes      | -                       | GitHub token for checkout                                                                 |
| `role_session_name` | No       | `GitHubActions-TF-Test` | AWS role session name for OIDC authentication                                             |

### Required Permissions

Add these permissions to your workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  checks: write
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  pull-requests: read
```

## How It Works

1. **Checkout**: Clones your repository
2. **Aqua Setup**: Installs and configures Aqua for dependency management
3. **AWS Configuration**: Sets up AWS credentials using OIDC
4. **Test Execution**: Runs `terraform init` and `terraform test` (or equivalent for OpenTofu)

## Dependencies

The action uses:

- [Aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) for dependency management
- [AWS OIDC](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) for AWS authentication
- [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) for repository access
- [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) for dependency caching
